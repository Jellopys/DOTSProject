# DOTSProject

This project is a school assignment where we need to use Unity DOTS (ECS, Jobs, Burst) to make a performant space shooter game.

Controls:
WASD - Movement
Mouse - Aim & Rotate
Left Mouse Button - Fire projectile

The projectiles, units and players are all Entities that are controlled by the Systems that updates each entity in various ways. 
The components that you add to the entities are what tells the systems which entity to update or check for. These components can be enabled, disabled, added and removed.
